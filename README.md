## Forrest, Salesforce.com REST API Client Library for PHP

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/omniphx/forrest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/omniphx/forrest)

This Salesforce.com REST API Client Libary is built to provide access to restricted Salesforce information via OAuth 2.0 using the Web Server OAuth Authentication Flow. This code is decoupled so that it can be extended into any Frameworks or vanilla PHP application.

Will release to Packagist when stable. Version 1.0 will support API Version 30.0 / Spring 14.
